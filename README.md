# CreditScoreClassification
Project Description :

The Credit Score Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify credit scores based on various financial and demographic features. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Features :

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Using various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Visualizing data distributions, feature importances, and model performance metrics.
